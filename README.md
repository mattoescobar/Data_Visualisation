# Description
Experiment with different data visualisation techniques, focusing mainly on Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) compared to other methodologies. GTM is a probabilistic manifold based data visualsation and dimenisonality reduction tool. 

# Installation
This repository contains a detailed GTM implementation from scratch in GTM.py, which relies on commonly available python packages.  
The Self-Organising Map (SOM) implementation comes from JustGlowing's MiniSom. (https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom)
AutoEncoders (AE) implementation uses Keras' neural network capabilities.

# Usage
The GTM folder presents a core implementation called GTM.py where other codes use it as reference for extra features or proof of concept implementations. More details on this sub-directory README.md.

DR_Comparison is using a three-dimensional scattered spherical dataset divided in two categories to show the nonlinear discriminatory capabilities of GTM, SOM, and AE. The code currently used can easily be modified to support other datasets.
